      "Chief.  \n",
      "I also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge Ryan Crocker, who recently completed his service as our \n",
      "Ambassador to Iraq. Throughout his career, Ryan always  took on the toughest assignments. He is an \n",
      "example of the very best that this nation has to offer, and we owe him a great debt of gratitude. He carried \n",
      "on his work with an extraordinary degree of cooperation with two of our finest Generals -- General David  \n",

      "Next month will mark the sixth anniversary of the war in Iraq. By any measure, this has already been a long \n",
      "war. For the men and women of America’s armed forces -- and for your families -- this war has been one of \n",
      "the most extraordinary chapters of service in the history of our nation. You have endured tour after tour after \n",
      "tour of duty. You have known the dangers of combat and the lonely dist ance of loved ones. You have fought \n",
      "against tyranny and disorder.    \n",

      " 2 You have bled for your best friends and for unknown Iraqis. And you have borne an enormous burden for \n",

      "circumstances, the men and women of the United States military have served with honor, and succeeded \n",
      "beyond any expectation.   \n",
      "Today, I have come to speak to you about how the war in Iraq will end.  \n",
      "To understand where we need to go in Iraq, it is i mportant for the American people to understand where we \n",
      "now stand. Thanks in great measure to your service, the situation in Iraq has improved. Violence has been \n",
      "reduced substantially from the horrific sectarian killing of 2006 and 2007. Al Qaeda in Iraq h as been dealt a \n",
      "serious blow by our troops and Iraq’s Security Forces, and through our partnership with Sunni Arabs. The \n",
      "capacity of Iraq’s Security Forces has improved, and Iraq’s leaders have taken steps toward political \n",
      "accommodation. The relative peace  and strong participation in January’s provincial elections sent a \n",
      "powerful message to the world about how far Iraqis have come in pursuing their aspirations through a \n",
      "peaceful political process.   \n",
      "But let there be no doubt: Iraq is not yet secure, and ther e will be difficult days ahead. Violence will continue \n",
      "to be a part of life in Iraq. Too many fundamental political questions about Iraq’s future remain unresolved. \n",
      "Too many Iraqis are still displaced or destitute. Declining oil revenues will put an added strain on a \n",
      "government that has had difficulty delivering basic services. Not all of Iraq’s neighbors are contributing to its \n",
      "security. Some are working at times to undermine it. And even as Iraq’s government is on a surer footing, it \n",
      "is not yet a full par tner -- politically and economically -- in the region, or with the international community  \n",
      "In short, today there is a renewed cause for hope in Iraq, but that hope rests upon an emerging foundation.  \n",
      "On my first full day in office, I directed my national secu rity team to undertake a comprehensive review of \n",
      "our strategy in Iraq to determine the best way to strengthen that foundation, while strengthening American \n",
      "national security. I have listened to my Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and comman ders on \n",
      "the ground. We have acted with careful consideration of events on the ground; with respect for the security \n",
      "agreements between the United States and Iraq; and with a critical recognition that the long -term solution in \n",
      "Iraq must be political -- not m ilitary. Because the most important decisions that have to be made about Iraq’s \n",
      "future must now be made by Iraqis.  \n",
      "We have also taken into account the simple reality that America can no longer afford to see Iraq in isolation \n",
      "from other priorities: we face the challenge of refocusing on Afghanistan and Pakistan; of relieving the \n",
      "burden on our military; and of rebuilding our struggling economy -- and these are challenges that we will \n",
      "meet.  \n",
      "Today, I can announce that our review is complete, and that the United States will pursue a new strategy to \n",
      "end the war in Iraq through a transition to full Iraqi responsibility.  \n",
      "This strategy is grounded in a clear and achievable goal shared by the Iraqi people and the American \n",
      "people: an Iraq that is sovereign, stable, and self-reliant.    \n",
      "  \n",
      " \n",
      " 3 To achieve that goal, we will work to promote an Iraqi government that is just, representative, and \n",
      "accountable, and that provides neither support nor safe -haven to terrorists. We will help Iraq build new ties \n",
      "of trade and commerce with the w orld. And we will forge a partnership with the people and government of \n",
      "Iraq that contributes to the peace and security of the region.  \n",
      "What we will not do is let the pursuit of the perfect stand in the way of achievable goals. We cannot rid Iraq \n",
      "of all who  oppose America or sympathize with our adversaries. We cannot police Iraq’s streets until they are \n",
      "completely safe, nor stay until Iraq’s union is perfected. We cannot sustain indefinitely a commitment that \n",
      "has put a strain on our military, and will cost t he American people nearly a trillion dollars. America’s men \n",
      "and women in uniform have fought block by block, province by province, year after year, to give the Iraqis \n",
      "this chance to choose a better future. Now, we must ask the Iraqi people to seize it.   \n",
      "The first part of this strategy is therefore the responsible removal of our combat brigades from Iraq.  \n",
      "As a candidate for President, I made clear my support for a timeline of 16 months to carry out this \n",
      "drawdown, while pledging to consult closely with our m ilitary commanders upon taking office to ensure that \n",
      "we preserve the gains we’ve made and protect our troops. Those consultations are now complete, and I \n",
      "have chosen a timeline that will remove our combat brigades over the next 18 months.  \n",
      "Let me say this a s plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.  \n",
      "As we carry out this drawdown, my highest priority will be the safety and security of our troops and civilians \n",
      "in Iraq. We will proceed carefully, and I will consult closely with my military commanders on the ground and \n",
      "with the Iraqi government. There will surely be difficult periods and tactical adjustments. But our enemies \n",
      "should be left with no doubt: this plan gives our military the forces and the flexibility they need to supp ort our \n",
      "Iraqi partners, and to succeed.  \n",
      "After we remove our combat brigades, our mission will change from combat to supporting the Iraqi \n",
      "government and its Security Forces as they take the absolute lead in securing their country. As I have long \n",
      "said, we wi ll retain a transitional force to carry out three distinct functions: training, equipping, and advising \n",
      "Iraqi Security Forces as long as they remain non -sectarian; conducting targeted counter -terrorism missions; \n",
      "and protecting our ongoing civilian and mili tary efforts within Iraq. Initially, this force will likely be made up of \n",
      "35-50,000 U.S. troops.  \n",
      "Through this period of transition, we will carry out further redeployments. And under the Status of Forces \n",
      "Agreement with the Iraqi government, I intend to rem ove all U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of 2011. We \n",
      "will complete this transition to Iraqi responsibility, and we will bring our troops home with the honor that they \n",
      "have earned.  \n",
      "As we responsibly remove our combat brigades, we will pursue the second part  of our strategy: sustained \n",
      "diplomacy on behalf of a more peaceful and prosperous Iraq.  \n",
      "   \n",
      "  \n",
      " \n",
      " 4 The drawdown of our military should send a clear signal that Iraq’s future is now its own responsibility. The \n",
      "long-term success of the Iraqi nation will depend upon dec isions made by Iraq’s leaders and the fortitude of \n",
      "the Iraqi people. Iraq is a sovereign country with legitimate institutions; America cannot -- and should not -- \n",
      "take their place. However, a strong political, diplomatic, and civilian effort on our part can advance progress \n",
      "and help lay a foundation for lasting peace and security.  \n",
      "This effort will be led by our new Ambassador to Iraq -- Chris Hill. From his time in the Peace Corps, to his \n",
      "work in Kosovo and Korea, Ambassador Hill has been tested, and he has sh own the pragmatism and skill \n",
      "that we need right now. He will be supported by the courageous and capable work of so many American \n",
      "diplomats and aid workers who are serving in Iraq.  \n",
      "Going forward, we can make a difference on several fronts. We will work with  the United Nations to support \n",
      "national elections, while helping Iraqis improve local government. We can serve as an honest broker in \n",
      "pursuit of fair and durable agreements on issues that have divided Iraq’s leaders. And just as we will support \n",
      "Iraq’s Secu rity Forces, we will help Iraqi institutions strengthen their capacity to protect the rule of law, \n",
      "confront corruption, and deliver basic services.  \n",
      "Diplomacy and assistance is also required to help the millions of displaced Iraqis. These men, women and \n",
      "children are a living consequence of this war and a challenge to stability in the region, and they must \n",
      "become a part of Iraq’s reconciliation and recovery. America has a strategic interest -- and a moral \n",
      "responsibility -- to act. In the coming months, my admin istration will provide more assistance and take steps \n",
      "to increase international support for countries already hosting refugees; we’ll cooperate with others to \n",
      "resettle Iraqis facing great personal risk; and we will work with the Iraqi government over time to resettle \n",
      "refugees and displaced Iraqis within Iraq -- because there are few more powerful indicators of lasting peace \n",
      "than displaced citizens returning home.  \n",
      "Now, before I go any further, I want to take a moment to speak directly to the people of Iraq.  \n",
      "You are a great nation, rooted in the cradle of civilization. You are joined together by enduring \n",
      "accomplishments, and a history that connects you as surely as the two rivers carved into your land. In years \n",
      "past, you have persevered through tyranny and terr or; through personal insecurity and sectarian violence. \n",
      "And instead of giving in to the forces of disunion, you stepped back from a descent into civil war, and \n",
      "showed a proud resilience that deserves respect.  \n",
      "Our nations have known difficult times together . But ours is a bond forged by shared bloodshed, and \n",
      "countless friendships among our people. We Americans have offered our most precious resource -- our \n",
      "young men and women -- to work with you to rebuild what was destroyed by despotism; to root out our \n",
      "common enemies; and to seek peace and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, and for yours.  \n",
      "There are those who will try to prevent that future for Iraq -- who will insist that Iraq’s differences cannot be \n",
      "reconciled without more killing. They represen t the forces that destroy nations and lead only to despair, and \n",
      "they will test our will in the months and years to come. America, too, has known these forces. We endured \n",
      "the pain of Civil War, and bitter divisions of region and race. But hostility and hatr ed are no match for justice; \n",
      "they offer no pathway to peace; and they must not stand between the people of Iraq and a future of \n",
      "reconciliation and hope.    \n",
      "  \n",
      " \n",
      " 5 So to the Iraqi people, let me be clear about America’s intentions. The United States pursues no claim on \n",
      "your territory or your resources. We respect your sovereignty and the tremendous sacrifices you have made \n",
      "for your country. We seek a full transition to Iraqi responsibility for the security of your country. And going \n",
      "forward, we can build a lasting rel ationship founded upon mutual interests and mutual respect as Iraq takes \n",
      "its rightful place in the community of nations.  \n",
      "That leads me to the third part of our strategy -- comprehensive American engagement across the region.  \n",
      "The future of Iraq is inseparable from the future of the broader Middle East, so we must work with our \n",
      "friends and partners to establish a new framework that advances Iraq’s security and the region’s. It is time \n",
      "for Iraq to be a full partner in a regional dialogue, and for Iraq ’s neighbors to establish productive and \n",
      "normalized relations with Iraq. And going forward, the United States will pursue principled and sustained \n",
      "engagement with all of the nations in the region, and that will include Iran and Syria.  \n",
      "This reflects a funda mental truth: we can no longer deal with regional challenges in isolation -- we need a \n",
      "smarter, more sustainable and comprehensive approach. That is why we are renewing our diplomacy, while \n",
      "relieving the burden on our military. That is why we are refocusing  on al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan; \n",
      "developing a strategy to use all elements of American power to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear \n",
      "weapon; and actively seeking a lasting peace between Israel and the Arab world.  And that is why we have \n",
      "named t hree of America’s most accomplished diplomats -- George Mitchell, Dennis Ross and Richard \n",
      "Holbrooke -- to support Secretary Clinton and me as we carry forward this agenda.   \n",
      "Every nation and every group must know -- whether you wish America good or ill -- that the end of the war in \n",
      "Iraq will enable a new era of American leadership and engagement in the Middle East. And that era has just \n",
      "begun.  \n",
      "Finally, I want to be very clear that my strategy for ending the war in Iraq does not end with military plans or \n",
      "diplo matic agendas -- it endures through our commitment to uphold our sacred trust with every man and \n",
      "woman who has served in Iraq.  \n",
      "You make up a fraction of the American population, but in an age when so many people and institutions \n",
      "have acted irresponsibly, yo u did the opposite -- you volunteered to bear the heaviest burden. And for you \n",
      "and for your families, the war does not end when you come home. It lives on in memories of your fellow \n",
      "soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who gave their lives. It endures in t he wound that is slow to heal, the \n",
      "disability that isn’t going away, the dream that wakes you at night, or the stiffening in your spine when a car \n",
      "backfires down the street.   \n",
      "You and your families have done your duty -- now a grateful nation must do ours. T hat is why I am \n",
      "increasing the number of soldiers and Marines, so that we lessen the burden on those who are serving. And \n",
      "that is why I have committed to expanding our system of veterans health care to serve more patients, and to \n",
      "provide better care in mor e places. We will continue building new wounded warrior facilities across America, \n",
      "and invest in new ways of identifying and treating the signature wounds of this war: Post -Traumatic Stress \n",
      "Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury, as well as other combat injur ies.   \n",
      "  \n",
      " \n",
      " 6 We also know that service does not end with the person wearing the uniform. In her visits with military \n",
      "families across the country, my wife Michelle has learned firsthand about the unique burden that your \n",
      "families endure every day. I want you to know  this: military families are a top priority for Michelle and me, \n",
      "and they will be a top priority for my administration. We’ll raise military pay, and continue providing quality \n",
      "child-care, job -training for spouses, and expanded counseling and outreach to f amilies that have known the \n",
      "separation and stress of war. We will also heed the lesson of history -- that those who fight in battle can \n",
      "form the backbone of our middle class -- by implementing a 21st century GI Bill to help our veterans live \n",
      "their dreams.  \n",
      "As a nation, we have had our share of debates about the war in Iraq. It has, at times, divided us as a \n",
      "people. To this very day, there are some Americans who want to stay in Iraq longer, and some who want to \n",
      "leave faster. But there should be no disagreement on what the men and women of our military have \n",
      "achieved.  \n",
      "And so I want to be very clear: We sent our troops to Iraq to do away with Saddam Hussein’s regime -- and \n",
      "you got the job done. We kept our troops in Iraq to help establish a sovereign government -- and you got the \n",
      "job done. And we will leave the Iraqi people with a hard -earned opportunity to live a better life -- that is your \n",
      "achievement; that is the prospect that you have made possible.  \n",
      "There are many lessons to be learned from what we’ve experienced. We have learned that America must \n",
      "go to war with clearly defined goals, which is why I’ve ordered a review of our policy in Afghanistan. We \n",
      "have learned that we must always weigh the costs of action, and communicate those costs candidly to the \n",
      "American peo ple, which is why I’ve put Iraq and Afghanistan into my budget. We have learned that in the \n",
      "21st century, we must use all elements of American power to achieve our objectives, which is why I am \n",
      "committed to building our civilian national security capacity so that the burden is not continually pushed on \n",
      "to our military. We have learned that our political leaders must pursue the broad and bipartisan support that \n",
      "our national security policies depend upon, which is why I will consult with Congress and in carry ing out my \n",
      "plans. And we have learned the importance of working closely with friends and allies, which is why we are \n",
      "launching a new era of engagement in the world.  \n",
      "The starting point for our policies must always be the safety of the American people. I kno w that you -- the \n",
      "men and women of the finest fighting force in the history of the world -- can meet any challenge, and defeat \n",
      "any foe. And as long as I am your Commander -in-Chief, I promise you that I will only send you into harm’s \n",
      "way when it is absolutely  necessary, and provide you with the equipment and support you need to get the \n",
      "job done. That is the most important lesson of all -- for the consequences of war are dire, the sacrifices \n",

      "vendor named Mohammed Bouazizi was devastated when a police officer confiscated his cart. \n",
      "This was not unique. It’s the same kind of humiliation that takes place every day in many \n",
      "parts of the world -- the rel entless tyranny of governments that deny their citizens dignity. \n",
      "Only this time, something different happened. After local officials refused to hear his \n",
      "complaints, this young man, who had never been particularly active in politics, went to the \n",
      "headquarter s of the provincial government, doused himself in fuel, and lit himself on fire.  \n",
      "There are times in the course of history when the actions of ordinary citizens spark \n",
      "movements for change because they speak to a longing for freedom that has been building up  \n",
      "for years. In America, think of the defiance of those patriots in Boston who refused to pay \n",
      "taxes to a King, or the dignity of Rosa Parks as she sat courageously in her seat. So it was in \n",
      "Tunisia, as that vendor’s act of desperation tapped into the frustr ation felt throughout the \n",
      "country. Hundreds of protesters took to the streets, then thousands. And in the face of batons \n",
      "and sometimes bullets, they refused to go home -- day after day, week after week -- until a \n",

      "to the region’s economy as well. Yes, some nations are blessed with wealth in oil and gas, and \n",
      "that has led to pockets of prosperity. But in a global economy based on knowledge, based on \n",

      "force of nonviolence, the people of the region have achieved more change in six months than \n",

      "Of course, change of this magnitude does not come easily. In our day and age -- a time of 24 -\n",

      "to people’s hopes; they’re  essential to them. We believe that no one benefits from a nuclear \n",
      "arms race in the region, or al Qaeda’s brutal attacks. We believe people everywhere would see \n",
      "their economies crippled by a cut -off in energy supplies. As we did in the Gulf War, we will no t \n",

      "partners.  \n",
      "Yet we must acknowledge that a strategy based solely upon the narrow pursuit of these \n",
      "interests will not fill an empty stomach or allow someone to speak their mind. Moreover, \n",
      "failure to speak to the broader aspirations of ordinary people will only feed the suspicion that \n",

      "that this m istrust runs both ways -- as Americans have been seared by hostage -taking and \n",
      "violent rhetoric and terrorist attacks that have killed thousands of our citizens -- a failure to \n",
      "change our approach threatens a deepening spiral of division between the United States and \n",
      "the Arab world.  \n",
      "And that’s why, two years ago in Cairo, I began to broaden our engagement based upon \n",
      "mutual interests and mutual respect. I believed then -- and I believe now -- that we have a \n",
      "stake not just in the stability of nations, but in t he self -determination of individuals. The \n",

      "illusion of stability for a time, but they are built upon fault lines that will eventually tear \n",

      "pursue the world as it should be.  \n",
      "Of course, as we do, we must proceed with a sense of hu mility. It’s not America that put \n",

      "The United States supports a set of universal rights. And these rights include free speech, the \n",
      "freedom of peace ful assembly, the freedom of religion, equality for men and women under the \n",

      "meet the legitimate aspirations of ordinary people throughout the region. Our support for \n",
      "these principles is not a secondary interest. Today I want to make it clear that it is a top \n",
      "priority that must be translated into concrete a ctions, and supported by all of the diplomatic, \n",
      "economic and strategic tools at our disposal.  \n",
      "Let me be specific. First, it will be the policy of the United States to promote reform across the \n",
      "region, and to support transitions to democracy. That effort be gins in Egypt and Tunisia, \n",
      "where the stakes are high -- as Tunisia was at the vanguard of this democratic wave, and \n",
      "Egypt is both a longstanding partner and the Arab world’s largest nation. Both nations can set \n",
      "a strong example through free and fair electi ons, a vibrant civil society, accountable and \n",
      "effective democratic institutions, and responsible regional leadership. But our support must \n",
      "also extend to nations where transitions have yet to take place.  \n",
      "Unfortunately, in too many countries, calls for chan ge have thus far been answered by \n",
      "violence. The most extreme example is Libya, where Muammar Qaddafi launched a war \n",
      "against his own people, promising to hunt them down like rats. As I said when the United \n",
      "States joined an international coalition to interve ne, we cannot prevent every injustice \n",
      "perpetrated by a regime against its people, and we have learned from our experience in Iraq \n",
      "just how costly and difficult it is to try to impose regime change by force -- no matter how \n",
      "well-intentioned it may be.  \n",
      "But in Libya, we saw the prospect of imminent massacre, we had a mandate for action, and \n",
      "heard the Libyan people’s call for help. Had we not acted along with our NATO allies and \n",
      "regional coalition partners, thousands would have been killed. The message would ha ve been \n",
      "clear: Keep power by killing as many people as it takes. Now, time is working against Qaddafi. \n",
      "He does not have control over his country. The opposition has organized a legitimate and \n",
      "credible Interim Council. And when Qaddafi inevitably leaves or is forced from power, decades \n",
      "of provocation will come to an end, and the transition to a democratic Libya can proceed.  \n",
      "While Libya has faced violence on the greatest scale, it’s not the only place where leaders \n",
      "have turned to repression to remain in power . Most recently, the Syrian regime has chosen \n",
      "the path of murder and the mass arrests of its citizens. The United States has condemned \n",
      "these actions, and working with the international community we have stepped up our \n",
      "sanctions on the Syrian regime -- including sanctions announced yesterday on President Assad \n",

      "have access to cities like Dara’a; and start a serious dialogue to advance a democ ratic \n",

      "suppression. And t his speaks to the hypocrisy of the Iranian regime, which says it stand for \n",
      "the rights of protesters abroad, yet represses its own people at home. Let’s remember that \n",
      "the first peaceful protests in the region were in the streets of Tehran, where the governm ent \n",

      "nuclear program and its support of terror, is well known. But if America is to be credible, we \n",
      "must acknowledge that at times our friends in the region have not all reacted to the demands \n",
      "for consistent change -- with change that’s consistent with the principles that I’ve outlined \n",
      "today. That’s true in Yemen, where Pres ident Saleh needs to follow through on his \n",
      "commitment to transfer power. And that’s true today in Bahrain.  \n",
      "Bahrain is a longstanding partner, and we are committed to its security. We recognize that \n",
      "Iran has tried to take advantage of the turmoil there, and  that the Bahraini government has a \n",
      "legitimate interest in the rule of law.  \n",
      "Nevertheless, we have insisted both publicly and privately that mass arrests and brute force \n",
      "are at odds with the universal rights of Bahrain’s citizens, and we will -- and such st eps will \n",
      "not make legitimate calls for reform go away. The only way forward is for the government and \n",
      "opposition to engage in a dialogue, and you can’t have a real dialogue when parts of the \n",
      "peaceful opposition are in jail. The government must create the c onditions for dialogue, and \n",
      "the opposition must participate to forge a just future for all Bahrainis.  \n",
      "Indeed, one of the broader lessons to be drawn from this period is that sectarian divides need \n",
      "not lead to conflict. In Iraq, we see the promise of a mult iethnic, multi -sectarian democracy. \n",
      "The Iraqi people have rejected the perils of political violence in favor of a democratic process, \n",
      "even as they’ve taken full responsibility for their own security. Of course, like all new \n",

      "continues its peaceful progress. And as they do, we will be proud to stand with them as a \n",
      "steadfast partner.  \n",
      "So in the months ahead, America must use all our influence to encourage reform in t he \n",
      "region. Even as we acknowledge that each country is different, we need to speak honestly \n",
      "about the principles that we believe in, with friend and foe alike. Our message is simple: If \n",
      "you take the risks that reform entails, you will have the full support  of the United States.  \n",

      "In short, today there is a renewed cause for hope in Iraq, but that hope rests upon an emerging foundation.  \n",

      "agreements between the United States and Iraq; and with a critical recognition that the long -term solution in \n",
      "Iraq must be political -- not m ilitary. Because the most important decisions that have to be made about Iraq’s \n",
      "future must now be made by Iraqis.  \n",

      "Today, I can announce that our review is complete, and that the United States will pursue a new strategy to \n",
      "end the war in Iraq through a transition to full Iraqi responsibility.  \n",
      "This strategy is grounded in a clear and achievable goal shared by the Iraqi people and the American \n",

      " \n",
      " 3 To achieve that goal, we will work to promote an Iraqi government that is just, representative, and \n",
      "accountable, and that provides neither support nor safe -haven to terrorists. We will help Iraq build new ties \n",
      "of trade and commerce with the w orld. And we will forge a partnership with the people and government of \n",
      "Iraq that contributes to the peace and security of the region.  \n",
      "What we will not do is let the pursuit of the perfect stand in the way of achievable goals. We cannot rid Iraq \n",
      "of all who  oppose America or sympathize with our adversaries. We cannot police Iraq’s streets until they are \n",
      "completely safe, nor stay until Iraq’s union is perfected. We cannot sustain indefinitely a commitment that \n",
      "has put a strain on our military, and will cost t he American people nearly a trillion dollars. America’s men \n",
      "and women in uniform have fought block by block, province by province, year after year, to give the Iraqis \n",
      "this chance to choose a better future. Now, we must ask the Iraqi people to seize it.   \n",
      "The first part of this strategy is therefore the responsible removal of our combat brigades from Iraq.  \n",
      "As a candidate for President, I made clear my support for a timeline of 16 months to carry out this \n",
      "drawdown, while pledging to consult closely with our m ilitary commanders upon taking office to ensure that \n",
      "we preserve the gains we’ve made and protect our troops. Those consultations are now complete, and I \n",
      "have chosen a timeline that will remove our combat brigades over the next 18 months.  \n",
      "Let me say this a s plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.  \n",
      "As we carry out this drawdown, my highest priority will be the safety and security of our troops and civilians \n",
      "in Iraq. We will proceed carefully, and I will consult closely with my military commanders on the ground and \n",
      "with the Iraqi government. There will surely be difficult periods and tactical adjustments. But our enemies \n",
      "should be left with no doubt: this plan gives our military the forces and the flexibility they need to supp ort our \n",
      "Iraqi partners, and to succeed.  \n",
      "After we remove our combat brigades, our mission will change from combat to supporting the Iraqi \n",
      "government and its Security Forces as they take the absolute lead in securing their country. As I have long \n",
      "said, we wi ll retain a transitional force to carry out three distinct functions: training, equipping, and advising \n",
      "Iraqi Security Forces as long as they remain non -sectarian; conducting targeted counter -terrorism missions; \n",
      "and protecting our ongoing civilian and mili tary efforts within Iraq. Initially, this force will likely be made up of \n",
      "35-50,000 U.S. troops.  \n",
      "Through this period of transition, we will carry out further redeployments. And under the Status of Forces \n",
      "Agreement with the Iraqi government, I intend to rem ove all U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of 2011. We \n",
      "will complete this transition to Iraqi responsibility, and we will bring our troops home with the honor that they \n",
      "have earned.  \n",
      "As we responsibly remove our combat brigades, we will pursue the second part  of our strategy: sustained \n",
      "diplomacy on behalf of a more peaceful and prosperous Iraq.  \n",

      "  \n",
      " \n",
      " 4 The drawdown of our military should send a clear signal that Iraq’s future is now its own responsibility. The \n",
      "long-term success of the Iraqi nation will depend upon dec isions made by Iraq’s leaders and the fortitude of \n",
      "the Iraqi people. Iraq is a sovereign country with legitimate institutions; America cannot -- and should not -- \n",
      "take their place. However, a strong political, diplomatic, and civilian effort on our part can advance progress \n",
      "and help lay a foundation for lasting peace and security.  \n",
      "This effort will be led by our new Ambassador to Iraq -- Chris Hill. From his time in the Peace Corps, to his \n",
      "work in Kosovo and Korea, Ambassador Hill has been tested, and he has sh own the pragmatism and skill \n",
      "that we need right now. He will be supported by the courageous and capable work of so many American \n",
      "diplomats and aid workers who are serving in Iraq.  \n",
      "Going forward, we can make a difference on several fronts. We will work with  the United Nations to support \n",
      "national elections, while helping Iraqis improve local government. We can serve as an honest broker in \n",
      "pursuit of fair and durable agreements on issues that have divided Iraq’s leaders. And just as we will support \n",
      "Iraq’s Secu rity Forces, we will help Iraqi institutions strengthen their capacity to protect the rule of law, \n",
      "confront corruption, and deliver basic services.  \n",
      "Diplomacy and assistance is also required to help the millions of displaced Iraqis. These men, women and \n",
      "children are a living consequence of this war and a challenge to stability in the region, and they must \n",
      "become a part of Iraq’s reconciliation and recovery. America has a strategic interest -- and a moral \n",
      "responsibility -- to act. In the coming months, my admin istration will provide more assistance and take steps \n",
      "to increase international support for countries already hosting refugees; we’ll cooperate with others to \n",
      "resettle Iraqis facing great personal risk; and we will work with the Iraqi government over time to resettle \n",
      "refugees and displaced Iraqis within Iraq -- because there are few more powerful indicators of lasting peace \n",
      "than displaced citizens returning home.  \n",
      "Now, before I go any further, I want to take a moment to speak directly to the people of Iraq.  \n",
      "You are a great nation, rooted in the cradle of civilization. You are joined together by enduring \n",
      "accomplishments, and a history that connects you as surely as the two rivers carved into your land. In years \n",
      "past, you have persevered through tyranny and terr or; through personal insecurity and sectarian violence. \n",
      "And instead of giving in to the forces of disunion, you stepped back from a descent into civil war, and \n",
      "showed a proud resilience that deserves respect.  \n",
      "Our nations have known difficult times together . But ours is a bond forged by shared bloodshed, and \n",
      "countless friendships among our people. We Americans have offered our most precious resource -- our \n",
      "young men and women -- to work with you to rebuild what was destroyed by despotism; to root out our \n",
      "common enemies; and to seek peace and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, and for yours.  \n",
      "There are those who will try to prevent that future for Iraq -- who will insist that Iraq’s differences cannot be \n",
