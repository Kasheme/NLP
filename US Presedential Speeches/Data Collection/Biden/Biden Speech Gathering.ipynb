      "Transcript\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Earlier today, I was briefed by our senior military and national security leaders on the status of the drawdown of U.S. forces and allied forces in Afghanistan.\n",
      "When I announced our drawdown in April, I said we would be out by September, and we’re on track to meet that target.\n",
      "Our military mission in Afghanistan will conclude on August 31st. The drawdown is proceeding in a secure and orderly way, prioritizing the safety of our troops as they depart.\n",
      "Our military commanders advised me that once I made the decision to end the war, we needed to move swiftly to conduct the main elements of the drawdown. And in this context, speed is safety.\n",
      "And thanks to the way in which we have managed our withdrawal, no one—no one U.S. forces or any forces have—have been lost. Conducting our drawdown differently would have certainly come with an increased risk of safety to our personnel.\n",
      "To me, those risks were unacceptable. And there was never any doubt that our military would perform this task efficiently and with the highest level of professionalism. That’s what they do. And the same is true of our NATO Allies and partners who have supported—we are supporting, and supporting us as well, as they conclude their retrograde.\n",
      "I want to be clear: The U.S. military mission in Afghanistan continues through the end of August. We remain—we retain personnel and capacities in the country, and we maintain some authority—excuse me, the same authority under which we’ve been operating for some time.\n",
      "As I said in April, the United States did what we went to do in Afghanistan: to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 and to deliver justice to Osama Bin Laden, and to degrade the terrorist threat to keep Afghanistan from becoming a base from which attacks could be continued against the United States. We achieved those objectives. That’s why we went.\n",
      "We did not go to Afghanistan to nation-build. And it’s the right and the responsibility of the Afghan people alone to decide their future and how they want to run their country.\n",
      "Together, with our NATO Allies and partners, we have trained and equipped over three hu-—nearly 300,000 current serving members of the military—of the Afghan National Security Force, and many beyond that who are no longer serving. Add to that, hundreds of thousands more Afghan National Defense and Security Forces trained over the last two decades.\n",
      "We provided our Afghan partners with all the tools—let me emphasize: all the tools, training, and equipment of any modern military. We provided advanced weaponry. And we’re going to continue to provide funding and equipment. And we’ll ensure they have the capacity to maintain their air force.\n",
      "But most critically, as I stressed in my meeting just two weeks ago with President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah, Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future that the Afghan people want and they deserve.\n",
      "In our meeting, I also assured Ghani that U.S. support for the people of Afghanistan will endure. We will continue to provide civilian and humanitarian assistance, including speaking out for the rights of women and girls.\n",
      "I intend to maintain our diplomatic presence in Afghanistan, and we are coordinating closely with our international partners in order to continue to secure the international airport.\n",
      "And we’re going to engage in a determined diplomacy to pursue peace and a peace agreement that will end this senseless violence.\n",
      "I’ve asked Secretary of State Blinken and our Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation to work vigorously with the parties in Afghanistan, as well as the regional and international stakeholders to support a negotiated solution.\n",
      "To be clear—to be clear: Countries in the region have an essential role to play in supporting a peaceful settlement. We’ll work with them, and they should help step up their efforts as well.\n",
      "We’re going to continue to work for the release of detained Americans, including Mark—excuse me—Fre– Frerichs—I want to pronounce the name correctly; I mis-—I misspoke—so that he can return to his family safely.\n",
      "We’re also going to continue to make sure that we take on the Afghan nationals who work side-by-side with U.S. forces, including interpreters and translators—since we’re no longer going to have military there after this; we’re not going to need them and they have no jobs—who are also going to be vital to our efforts so they—and they’ve been very vital—and so their families are not exposed to danger as well.\n",
      "We’ve already dramatically accelerated the procedure time for Special Immigrant Visas to bring them to the United States.\n",
      "Since I was inaugurated on January 20th, we’ve already approved 2,500 Special Immigrant Visas to come to the United States. Up to now, fewer than half have exercised their right to do that. Half have gotten on aircraft and com—commercial flights and come, and the other half believe they want to stay—at least thus far.\n",
      "We’re working closely with Congress to change the authorization legislation so that we can streamline the process of approving those visas. And those who have stood up for the operation to physically relocate thousands of Afghans and their families before the U.S. military mission concludes so that, if they choose, they can wait safely outside of Afghanistan while their U.S. visas are being processed.\n",
      "The operation has identified U.S. facilities outside of the continental United States, as well as in third countries, to host our Afghan allies, if they ch-—if they so choose. And, starting this month, we’re going to begin to re-—re-—reloc-—we’re going to begin relocation flights for Afghanistan SIV applicants and their families who choose to leave.\n",
      "We have a point person in the White House and at the State Department-led task force coordinating all these efforts.\n",
      "But our message to those women and men is clear: There is a home for you in the United States if you so choose, and we will stand with you just as you stood with us.\n",
      "When I made the decision to end the U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, I judged that it was not in the national interest of the United States of America to continue fighting this war indefinitely. I made the decision with clear eyes, and I am briefed daily on the battlefield updates.\n",
      "But for those who have argued that we should stay just six more months or just one more year, I ask them to consider the lessons of recent history.\n",
      "In 2011, the NATO Allies and partners agreed that we would end our combat mission in 2014. In 2014, some argued, “One more year.” So we kept fighting, and we kept taking casualties. In 2015, the same. And on and on.\n",
      "Nearly 20 years of experience has shown us that the current security situation only confirms that “just one more year” of fighting in Afghanistan is not a solution but a recipe for being there indefinitely.\n",
      "It’s up to Afghans to make the decision about the future of their country.\n",
      "Others are more direct. Their argument is that we should stay with the Afghan—in Afghanistan indefinitely. In doing so, they point to the fact that we—we have not taken losses in this last year, so they claim that the cost of just maintaining the status quo is minimal.\n",
      "But that ignores the reality and the facts that already presented on the ground in Afghanistan when I took office: The Taliban was at its strongest mil-—is at its strongest militarily since 2001.\n",
      "The number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan had been reduced to a bare minimum. And the United States, in the last administration, made an agreement that the—with the Taliban to remove all our forces by May 1 of this past—of this year. That’s what I inherited. That agreement was the reason the Taliban had ceased major attacks against U.S. forces.\n",
      "If, in April, I had instead announced that the United States was going to back—going back on that agreement made by the last administration—[that] the United States and allied forces would remain in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future—the Taliban would have again begun to target our forces.\n",
      "The status quo was not an option. Staying would have meant U.S. troops taking casualties; American men and women back in the middle of a civil war. And we would have run the risk of having to send more troops back into Afghanistan to defend our remaining troops.\n",
      "Once that agreement with the Taliban had been made, staying with a bare minimum force was no longer possible.\n",
      "So let me ask those who wanted us to stay: How many more—how many thousands more of America’s daughters and sons are you willing to risk? How long would you have them stay?\n",
      "Already we have members of our military whose parents fought in Afghanistan 20 years ago. Would you send their children and their grandchildren as well? Would you send your own son or daughter?\n",
      "After 20 years—a trillion dollars spent training and equipping hundreds of thousands of Afghan National Security and Defense Forces, 2,448 Americans killed, 20,722 more wounded, and untold thousands coming home with unseen trauma to their mental health—I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome.\n",
      "The United States cannot afford to remain tethered to policies creating a response to a world as it was 20 years ago. We need to meet the threats where they are today.\n",
      "Today, the terrorist threat has metastasized beyond Afghanistan. So, we are repositioning our resources and adapting our counterterrorism posture to meet the threats where they are now significantly higher: in South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.\n",
      "But make no mistake: Our military and intelligence leaders are confident they have the capabilities to protect the homeland and our interests from any resurgent terrorist challenge emerging or emanating from Afghanistan.\n",
      "We are developing a counterterrorism over-the-horizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region, and act quickly and decisively if needed.\n",
      "And we also need to focus on shoring up America’s core strengths to meet the strategic competition with China and other nations that is really going to determine—determine our future.\n",
      "We have to defeat COVID-19 at home and around the world, make sure we’re better prepared for the next pandemic or biological threat.\n",
      "We need to establish international norms for cyberspace and the use of emergenc-—emerging technologies.\n",
      "We need to take concerted action to fight existential threats of climate change.\n",
      "And we will be more formidable to our adversaries and competitors over the long run if we fight the battles of the next 20 years, not the last 20 years.\n",
      "Finally, I want to recognize the incredible sacrifice and dedication that the U.S. military and civilian personnel, serving alongside our Allies and partners, have made over the last two decades in Afghanistan.\n",
      "I want to honor the significance of what they’ve accomplished and the great personal risk they encountered and the incredible cost to their families: pursuing the terrorist threat in some of the most unforgiving terrain on the planet—and I’ve been almost throughout that entire country; ensuring there hasn’t been another attack on the homeland from Afghanistan for the last 20 years; taking out Bin Laden.\n",
      "I want to thank you all for your service and the dedication to the mission so many of you have given, and to the sacrifices that you and your families have made over the long course of this war.\n",
      "We’ll never forget those who gave the last full measure of devotion for their country in Afghanistan, nor those whose lives have been immeasurably altered by wounds sustained in service to their country.\n",
      "We’re ending America’s longest war, but we’ll always, always honor the bravery of the American patriots who served in it.\n",
      "May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.\n",
      "Q: Mr. President—do you trust the Taliban, Mr. President?\n",
      "Q: Is a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan now inevitable?\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: No, it is not.\n",
      "Q: Why?\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: Because you—the Afghan troops have 300,000 well-equipped—as well-equipped as any army in the world—and an air force against something like 75,000 Taliban. It is not inevitable.\n",
      "Q: Do you trust the Taliban, Mr. President? Do you trust the Taliban, sir?\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: You—is that a serious question?\n",
      "Q: It is absolutely a serious question. Do you trust the Taliban?\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: No, I do not.\n",
      "Q: Do you trust handing over the country to the Taliban?\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: No, I do not trust the Taliban.\n",
      "Q: So why are you handing the country over?\n",
      "Q: Mr. President, is the U.S. responsible for the deaths of Afghans after you leave the country?\n",
      "Q: Mr. President, will you amplify that question, please? Will you amplify your answer, please—why you don’t trust the Taliban?\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: It’s a—it’s a silly question. Do I trust the Taliban? No. But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped, and more re-—more competent in terms of conducting war.Yes, ma’am.\n",
      "Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Given the amount of money that has been spent and the number of lives that have been lost, in your view, with making this decision, were the last 20 years worth it?\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: You know my record. I can tell by the way you asked the question.\n",
      "I opposed permanently having American forces in Afghanistan. I argued, from the beginning, as you may recall—it came to light after the administration was over, last—our administration—no nation has ever unified Afghanistan. No nation. Empires have gone there and not done it.\n",
      "The focus we had—and I strongly support it—and you may remember I physically went to Afghanistan. I was up in that pass where Osama bin Laden was—allegedly escaped or—out of harm’s way.\n",
      "We went for two reasons: one, to bring Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, as I said at the time. The second reason was to eliminate al Qaeda’s capacity to deal with more attacks on the United States from that territory. We accomplished both of those objectives—period.\n",
      "That’s what I believed, from the beginning, why we should be and why we should have gone to Afghanistan. That job had been over for some time. And that’s why I believe that this is the right decision and, quite frankly, overdue.\n",
      "Q: Mr. President, has the civilian government hailed the people of Afghanistan?\n",
      "Q: Mr. President, thank you very much. Your own intelligence community has assessed that the Afghan government will likely collapse.\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: That is not true.\n",
      "Q: Is it—can you please clarify what they have told you about whether that will happen or not?\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: That is not true. They did not—they didn’t—did not reach that conclusion.\n",
      "Q: So what is the level of confidence that they have that it will not collapse?\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: The Afghan government and leadership has to come together. They clearly have the capacity to sustain the government in place. The question is: Will they generate the kind of cohesion to do it? It’s not a question of whether they have the capacity. They have the capacity. They have the forces. They have the equipment. The question is: Will they do it?\n",
      "And I want to make clear what I made clear to Ghani: that we are not going just sus-—walk away and not sustain their ability to maintain that force. We are. We’re going to also work to make sure we help them in terms of everything from food necessities and other things in—in the region. But—but, there’s not a conclusion that, in fact, they cannot defeat the Taliban.\n",
      "I believe the only way there’s going to be—this is now Joe Biden, not the intelligence community—the only way there’s ultimately going to be peace and security in Afghanistan is that they work out a modus vivendi with the Taliban and they make a judgment as to how they can make peace.\n",
      "And the likelihood there’s going to be one unified government in Afghanistan controlling the whole country is highly unlikely.\n",
      "Q: Mr. President, thank you. But we have talked to your own top general in Afghanistan, General Scott Miller. He told ABC News the conditions are so concerning at this point that it could result in a civil war. So, if Kabul falls to the Taliban, what will the United States do about it?\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: Look, you’ve said two things—one, that if it could result in a civil war—that’s different than the Taliban succeeding, number one. Number two, the question of what will be done is going to be implicated—is going to implicate the entire region as well. There’s a number of countries who have a grave concern about what’s going to happen in Afghanistan relative to their security.\n",
      "The question is: How much of a threat to the United States of America and to our allies is whatever results in terms of a government or an agreement? That’s when that judgement will be made.\n",
      "Q: Mr. President, some Vietnamese veterans see echoes of their experience in this withdrawal in Afghanistan. Do you see any parallels between this withdrawal and what happened in Vietnam, with some people feeling —\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: None whatsoever. Zero. What you had is—you had entire brigades breaking through the gates of our embassy—six, if I’m not mistaken.\n",
      "The Taliban is not the south—the North Vietnamese army. They’re not—they’re not remotely comparable in terms of capability. There’s going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of an embassy in the—of the United States from Afghanistan. It is not at all comparable.\n",
      "Q: And, Mr. President —\n",
      "Q: Mr. President, can I —\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: I’ll take him and then I’ll—and then I’ll go—I’ll go to the other side. Hang on a second.\n",
      "Q: Mr. President, how serious was the corruption among the Afghanistan government to this mission failing there?\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, the mission hasn’t failed, yet. There is in Afghanistan—in all parties, there’s been corruption. The question is, can there be an agreement on unity of purpose? What is the objective?\n",
      "For example, it started off—there were going to be negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan National Security Forces and the Afghan government. That—that of—it didn’t come to—it didn’t come to fruition.\n",
      "So the question now is, where do they go from here? That—the jury is still out. But the likelihood there’s going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.\n",
      "Yes, ma’am.\n",
      "Q: Mr. President, will the United States be responsible for the loss of Afghan civilian lives that could happen after a —\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: No.\n",
      "Q:—military exit?\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: No, no, no. It’s up to the people of Afghanistan to decide on what government they want, not us to impose the government on them. No country has ever been able to do that.\n",
      "Keep in mind, as a student of history, as I’m sure you are, never has Afghanistan been a united country, not in all of its history. Not in all of its history.\n",
      "Q: Mr. President, if this isn’t a “mission accomplished” moment, what is it, in your view?\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: No, there’s no “mission accomplished.”\n",
      "Q: How would you describe it?\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: The mission was accomplished in that we get—got Osama bin Laden, and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world.\n",
      "Q: Mr. President, if “speed is safety,” as you just said in your remarks, are you satisfied with the timeline of relocating Afghan nationals? Is it happening quickly enough to your satisfaction, if it may not happen until next month, at the end?\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: Well, much of it has already happened. There’s already been people—about a thousand people have gotten on aircraft and come home—come to the United States already on commercial aircraft. So, as I said, there’s over 2,500 people that as—from January to now, have gotten those visas. And only half decided that they wanted to leave.\n",
      "The point is that I think the whole process has to be speeded up, period, in terms of being able to get these visas.\n",
      "Q: Why can’t the U.S. evacuate these Afghan translators to the United States to await their visa processing as some immigrants at the southern border have been allowed to do?\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: Because the law doesn’t allow that to happen. And that’s why we’re asking the Congress to consider changing the law.\n",
      "But in the meantime, we can guarantee their safety, if they wish to leave, by taking them to third countries and/or, while the wait is taking place, to come to—to—and hopefully, while they’re waiting there, to be able to bring them back to the United States, if that’s what they choose to do.\n",
      "Q: And what do you make—and what do you make, sir, of the Taliban being in Russia today?\n",
      "Q: Mr. President, I’m from Afghanistan. I am Afghan (inaudible) woman. Any message—good message for Afghan women in future? Because they have achievement—they are really concerned about their achievement.\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: They are very concerned, with good reason.\n",
      "Q: Yes.\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: When I was in Afghanistan—I’ve been there a number of times—I remember being in a school outside and—and, by the way, the schools in Afghanistan are not fundamentally unlike schools in the West Coast, where they have, you know, a—an area in the middle that is sort of like—it looks like a playground and single-story buildings connected around it.\n",
      "And I remember saying to—speaking to a group of young women—I guess they were roughly—don’t hold me to this—they look like they’d be 14, 15 years old. And they’re in school, and there’s a tiered classroom with single light bulbs hanging from the ceiling, as I know you know.\n",
      "And I said, “You know, the United States came here to make sure that we got this terrorist, Osama bin Laden, and that terrorists didn’t amass again to—to go after our country. And then we’re going to have to leave.” And a young woman said, “You can’t leave. You can’t leave.” It was—it was heartbreaking. “You can’t leave,” she said. “I want to be a doctor. I want to be a doctor. I want to be a doctor. If you leave, I’ll never be able to be a doctor.” Well, that’s why we spent so much time and money training the Afghan Security Forces to do the work of defending that. If every work —\n",
      "Well, anyway—so, yes, I’m aware.\n",
      "I’m going to take one more question.\n",
      "Q: Mr. President, have you spoken with any Taliban officials about the withdrawal?\n",
      "Q: (Inaudible) the Taliban being in Russia today—the Taliban —\n",
      "Q: Mr.—Mr. President, I—thank you. I wanted to ask: With the benefit of hindsight, you’ve spoken to the fact that the Taliban are sort of at their militarily strongest point that you’ve seen in 20 years. How do you feel personally about that, with the benefit of hindsight and all of the dollars and investments and American troops that were sent there?\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: Relative to the training and capacity of the ANSF and the training of the federal police, they’re not even close in terms of their capacity.\n",
      "I was making the point—the point was that here we were; I was—the argument is, “Well, we could stay because no one was dying. No Americans are being shot. So why leave?” Once the agreement was made by the last administration that we were going to leave by May 1st, it was very clear that a Taliban that had always been a problem was even a more sophisticated problem than they were than before. Not more sophisticated than the ANSF, the government. More than they were.\n",
      "The point being that it would have increased the prospect that they would have been able to take more lives of Americans if they decided we weren’t going to go after them. That was the point I was making.\n",
      "Thank you all so very much. Thank you.\n",

      "We went to Afghanistan almost 20 years ago with clear goals: get those who attacked us on September 11th, 2001, and make sure al Qaeda could not use Afghanistan as a base from which to attack us again.\n",
      "\n",
      "We did that. We severely degraded al Qaeda in Afghanistan. We never gave up the hunt for Osama bin Laden, and we got him. That was a decade ago. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to have been nation building. It was never supposed to be creating a unified, centralized democracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our only vital national interest in Afghanistan remains today what it has always been: preventing a terrorist attack on American homeland.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve argued for many years that our mission should be narrowly focused on counterterrorism—not counterinsurgency or nation building. That’s why I opposed the surge when it was proposed in 2009 when I was Vice President.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that’s why, as President, I am adamant that we focus on the threats we face today in 2021—not yesterday’s threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, the terrorist threat has metastasized well beyond Afghanistan: al Shabaab in Somalia, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Nusra in Syria, ISIS attempting to create a caliphate in Syria and Iraq and establishing affiliates in multiple countries in Africa and Asia. These threats warrant our attention and our resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "We conduct effective counterterrorism missions against terrorist groups in multiple countries where we don’t have a permanent military presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "If necessary, we will do the same in Afghanistan. We’ve developed counterterrorism over-the-horizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region and to act quickly and decisively if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I came into office, I inherited a deal that President Trump negotiated with the Taliban. Under his agreement, U.S. forces would be out of Afghanistan by May 1, 2021—just a little over three months after I took office.\n",
      "\n",
      "U.S. forces had already drawn down during the Trump administration from roughly 15,500 American forces to 2,500 troops in country, and the Taliban was at its strongest militarily since 2001.\n",
      "\n",
      "The choice I had to make, as your President, was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban in the middle of the spring fighting season.\n",
      "\n",
      "There would have been no ceasefire after May 1. There was no agreement protecting our forces after May 1. There was no status quo of stability without American casualties after May 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was only the cold reality of either following through on the agreement to withdraw our forces or escalating the conflict and sending thousands more American troops back into combat in Afghanistan, lurching into the third decade of conflict. \n",
      "\n",
      "I stand squarely behind my decision. After 20 years, I’ve learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw U.S. forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why we were still there. We were clear-eyed about the risks. We planned for every contingency.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I always promised the American people that I will be straight with you. The truth is: This did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what’s happened? Afghanistan political leaders gave up and fled the country. The Afghan military collapsed, sometimes without trying to fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anything, the developments of the past week reinforced that ending U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan now was the right decision. \n",
      "\n",
      "American troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves. We spent over a trillion dollars. We trained and equipped an Afghan military force of some 300,000 strong—incredibly well equipped—a force larger in size than the militaries of many of our NATO allies. \n",
      "\n",
      "We gave them every tool they could need. We paid their salaries, provided for the maintenance of their air force—something the Taliban doesn’t have. Taliban does not have an air force. We provided close air support. \n",
      "\n",
      "We gave them every chance to determine their own future. What we could not provide them was the will to fight for that future.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s some very brave and capable Afghan special forces units and soldiers, but if Afghanistan is unable to mount any real resistance to the Taliban now, there is no chance that 1 year—1 more year, 5 more years, or 20 more years of U.S. military boots on the ground would’ve made any difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "And here’s what I believe to my core: It is wrong to order American troops to step up when Afghanistan’s own armed forces would not. If the political leaders of Afghanistan were unable to come together for the good of their people, unable to negotiate for the future of their country when the chips were down, they would never have done so while U.S. troops remained in Afghanistan bearing the brunt of the fighting for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And our true strategic competitors—China and Russia—would love nothing more than the United States to continue to funnel billions of dollars in resources and attention into stabilizing Afghanistan indefinitely.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I hosted President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah at the White House in June and again when I spoke by phone to Ghani in July, we had very frank conversations. We talked about how Afghanistan should prepare to fight their civil wars after the U.S. military departed, to clean up the corruption in government so the government could function for the Afghan people. We talked extensively about the need for Afghan leaders to unite politically. \n",
      "\n",
      "They failed to do any of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also urged them to engage in diplomacy, to seek a political settlement with the Taliban. This advice was flatly refused. Mr. Ghani insisted the Afghan forces would fight, but obviously he was wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I’m left again to ask of those who argue that we should stay: How many more generations of America’s daughters and sons would you have me send to fight Afghans—Afghanistan’s civil war when Afghan troops will not?  How many more lives—American lives—is it worth? How many endless rows of headstones at Arlington National Cemetery?\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m clear on my answer: I will not repeat the mistakes we’ve made in the past—the mistake of staying and fighting indefinitely in a conflict that is not in the national interest of the United States, of doubling down on a civil war in a foreign country, of attempting to remake a country through the endless military deployments of U.S. forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those are the mistakes we cannot continue to repeat, because we have significant vital interests in the world that we cannot afford to ignore.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also want to acknowledge how painful this is to so many of us. The scenes we’re seeing in Afghanistan, they’re gut-wrenching, particularly for our veterans, our diplomats, humanitarian workers, for anyone who has spent time on the ground working to support the Afghan people.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those who have lost loved ones in Afghanistan and for Americans who have fought and served in the country—serve our country in Afghanistan—this is deeply, deeply personal.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is for me as well. I’ve worked on these issues as long as anyone. I’ve been throughout Afghanistan during this war—while the war was going on—from Kabul to Kandahar to the Kunar Valley.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve traveled there on four different occasions. I met with the people. I’ve spoken to the leaders. I spent time with our troops. And I came to understand firsthand what was and was not possible in Afghanistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, now we’re fercus [sic]—focused on what is possible. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will continue to support the Afghan people. We will lead with our diplomacy, our international influence, and our humanitarian aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll continue to push for regional diplomacy and engagement to prevent violence and instability.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll continue to speak out for the basic rights of the Afghan people—of women and girls—just as we speak out all over the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been clear that human rights must be the center of our foreign policy, not the periphery. But the way to do it is not through endless military deployments; it’s with our diplomacy, our economic tools, and rallying the world to join us. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let me lay out the current mission in Afghanistan. I was asked to authorize—and I did—6,000 U.S. troops to deploy to Afghanistan for the purpose of assisting in the departure of U.S. and Allied civilian personnel from Afghanistan, and to evacuate our Afghan allies and vulnerable Afghans to safety outside of Afghanistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our troops are working to secure the airfield and to ensure continued operation of both the civilian and military flights. We’re taking over air traffic control. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have safely shut down our embassy and transferred our diplomats. Our dip-—our diplomatic presence is now consolidated at the airport as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the coming days, we intend to transport out thousands of American citizens who have been living and working in Afghanistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll also continue to support the safe departure of civilian personnel—the civilian personnel of our Allies who are still serving in Afghanistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operation Allies Refugee [Refuge], which I announced back in July, has already moved 2,000 Afghans who are eligible for Special Immigration Visas and their families to the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the coming days, the U.S. military will provide assistance to move more SIV-eligible Afghans and their families out of Afghanistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re also expanding refugee access to cover other vulnerable Afghans who worked for our embassy: U.S. non-governmental agencies—or the U.S. non-governmental organizations; and Afghans who otherwise are at great risk; and U.S. news agencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that there are concerns about why we did not begin evacuating Afghans—civilians sooner. Part of the answer is some of the Afghans did not want to leave earlier—still hopeful for their country. And part of it was because the Afghan government and its supporters discouraged us from organizing a mass exodus to avoid triggering, as they said, “a crisis of confidence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "American troops are performing this mission as professionally and as effectively as they always do, but it is not without risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we carry out this departure, we have made it clear to the Taliban: If they attack our personnel or disrupt our operation, the U.S. presence will be swift and the response will be swift and forceful. We will defend our people with devastating force if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our current military mission will be short in time, limited in scope, and focused in its objectives: Get our people and our allies to safety as quickly as possible. \n",
      "\n",
      "And once we have completed this mission, we will conclude our military withdrawal. We will end America’s longest war after 20 long years of bloodshed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The events we’re seeing now are sadly proof that no amount of military force would ever deliver a stable, united, and secure Afghanistan—as known in history as the “graveyard of empires.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What is happening now could just as easily have happened 5 years ago or 15 years in the future. We have to be honest: Our mission in Afghanistan has taken many missteps—made many missteps over the past two decades. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m now the fourth American President to preside over war in Afghanistan—two Democrats and two Republicans. I will not pass this responsibly on—responsibility on to a fifth President.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will not mislead the American people by claiming that just a little more time in Afghanistan will make all the difference. Nor will I shrink from my share of responsibility for where we are today and how we must move forward from here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am President of the United States of America, and the buck stops with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am deeply saddened by the facts we now face. But I do not regret my decision to end America’s warfighting in Afghanistan and maintain a laser-focus on our counterterrorism missions there and in other parts of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our mission to degrade the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and kill Osama bin Laden was a success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our decades-long effort to overcome centuries of history and permanently change and remake Afghanistan was not, and I wrote and believed it never could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot and I will not ask our troops to fight on endlessly in another—in another country’s civil war, taking casualties, suffering life-shattering injuries, leaving families broken by grief and loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not in our national security interest. It is not what the American people want. It is not what our troops, who have sacrificed so much over the past two decades, deserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "I made a commitment to the American people when I ran for President that I would bring America’s military involvement in Afghanistan to an end. And while it’s been hard and messy—and yes, far from perfect—I’ve honored that commitment.\n",
      "\n",
      "More importantly, I made a commitment to the brave men and women who serve this nation that I wasn’t going to ask them to continue to risk their lives in a military action that should have ended long ago. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our leaders did that in Vietnam when I got here as a young man. I will not do it in Afghanistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know my decision will be criticized, but I would rather take all that criticism than pass this decision on to another President of the United States—yet another one—a fifth one. \n",
      "\n",
      "Because it’s the right one—it’s the right decision for our people. The right one for our brave service members who have risked their lives serving our nation. And it’s the right one for America. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, thank you. May God protect our troops, our diplomats, and all of the brave Americans serving in harm’s way.\n",

      "THE PRESIDENT: Been a tough day. This evening in Kabul, as you all know, terrorists attacked—that we’ve been talking about and worried about, that the intelligence community has assessed has [was] undertaken—an attack—by a group known as ISIS-K—took the lives of American service members standing guard at the airport, and wounded several others seriously. They also wounded a number of civilians, and civilians were killed as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been engaged all day and in constant contact with the military commanders here in Washington, the Pentagon, as well as in Afghanistan and Doha. And my commanders here in Washington and in the field have been on this with great detail, and you’ve had a chance to speak to some, so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation on the ground is still evolving, and I’m constantly being updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "These American service members who gave their lives—it’s an overused word, but it’s totally appropriate—they were heroes. Heroes who have been engaged in a dangerous, selfless mission to save the lives of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were part of an airlift, an evacuation effort unlike any seen in history, with more than 100,000 American citizens, American partners, Afghans who helped us, and others taken to safety in the last 11 days. Just in the last 12 hours or so, another 7,000 have gotten out.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were part of the bravest, most capable, and the most selfless military on the face of the Earth. And they were part of, simply, what I call the “backbone of America.” They’re the spine of America, the best the country has to offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jill and I—our hearts ache, like I’m sure all of you do as well, for all those Afghan families who have lost loved ones, including small children, or been wounded in this vicious attack. And we’re outraged as well as heartbroken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being the father of an Army major who served for a year in Iraq and, before that, was in Kosovo as a U.S. attorney for the better part of six months in the middle of a war—when he came home after a year in Iraq, he was diagnosed, like many, many coming home, with an aggressive and lethal cancer of the brain—who we lost. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have some sense, like many of you do, what the families of these brave heroes are feeling today. You get this feeling like you’re being sucked into a black hole in the middle of your chest; there’s no way out. My heart aches for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I know this: We have a continuing obligation, a sacred obligation to all of you—the families of those heroes. That obligation is not temporary; it lasts forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lives we lost today were lives given in the service of liberty, the service of security, in the service of others, in the service of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like their fellow brothers and sisters in arms who died defending our vision and our values in the struggle against terrorism of—the fallen this day, they’re part of a great and noble company of American heroes.\n",
      "\n",
      "To those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay. I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my command.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past few weeks—I know you’re—many of you are probably tired of hearing me say it—we’ve been made aware by our intelligence community that the ISIS-K—an arch-enemy of the Taliban; people who were freed when both those prisons were opened—has been planning a complex set of attacks on the United States personnel and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why, from the outset, I’ve repeatedly said this mission was extraordinarily dangerous and why I have been so determined to limit the duration of this mission.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as General McKenzie said, this is why our mission was designed—this is the way it was designed to operate: operate under severe stress and attack. We’ve known that from the beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as I’ve been in constant contact with our senior military leaders—and I mean constant, around the clock—and our commanders on the ground and throughout the day, they made it clear that we can and we must complete this mission, and we will. And that’s what I’ve ordered them to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will not be deterred by terrorists. We will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve also ordered my commanders to develop operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership, and facilities. We will respond with force and precision at our time, at the place we choose, and the moment of our choosing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here is what you need to know: These ISIS terrorists will not win. We will rescue the Americans who are there. We will get out our Afghan allies out, and our mission will go on. \n",
      "\n",
      "America will not be intimidated. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have the utmost confidence in our brave service members who continue to execute this mission with courage and honor to save lives and get Americans, our partners, our Afghan allies out of Afghanistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every day when I talk to our commanders, I ask them what they need—what more do they need, if anything, to get the job done. As they will tell you, I granted every request. \n",
      "\n",
      "I reiterated to them again today, on three occasions, that they should take the maximum steps necessary to protect our forces on the ground in Kabul.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I also want to thank the Secretary of Defense and the military leadership at the Pentagon, and all the commanders in the field. There has been complete unanimity from every commander on the objectives of this mission and the best way to achieve those objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who have served through the ages have drawn inspiration from the Book of Isaiah, when the Lord says, “Whom shall I send…who shall go for us?” And the American military has been answering for a long time: “Here am I, Lord. Send me.” “Here I am. Send me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Each one of these women and men of our armed forces are the heirs of that tradition of sacrifice of volunteering to go into harm’s way, to risk everything—not for glory, not for profit, but to defend what we love and the people we love.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I ask that you join me now in a moment of silence for all those in uniform and out uniform—military and civilian, who have given the last full measure of devotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "(A moment of silence is taken.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you. May God bless you all. And may God protect those troops and all those standing watch for America. We have so much to do. It’s within our capacity to do it. We just have to remain steadfast. Steadfast. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will complete our mission. And we will continue, after our troops have withdrawn, to find means by which we defined any American who wishes to get out of Afghanistan. We will find them and we will get them out. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ladies and gentlemen, they gave me a list here. The first person I was instructed to call on was Kelly O’Donnell of NBC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q Mr. President, you have said leaving Afghanistan is in the national interest of the United States. After today’s attack, do you believe you will authorize additional forces to respond to that attack inside Afghanistan? And are you—are you prepared to add additional forces to protect those Americans who remain on the ground carrying out the evacuation operation?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: I’ve instructed the military, whatever they need—if they need additional force—I will grant it. But the military—from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Joint Chiefs, the commanders in the field—have all contacted me one way or another, usually by letter, saying they subscribe to the mission as designed to get as many people out as we can within the timeframe that is allotted. That is the best way, they believe, to get as many Americans out as possible, and others. \n",
      "\n",
      "And with regard to finding, tracking down the ISIS leaders who ordered this, we have some reason to believe we know who they are—not certain—and we will find ways of our choosing, without large military operations, to get them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Inside Afghanistan, Mr. President?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: Wherever they are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trevor from Reuters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Thank you, Mr. President. There has been some criticism, even from people in your party, about the dependence on the Taliban to secure the perimeter of the airport. Do you feel like there was a mistake made in that regard?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: No, I don’t. Look, I think General McKenzie handled this question very well. The fact is that we’re in a situation—we inherited a situation, particularly since, as we all know, that the Afghan military collapsed 11 days before—in 11 days—that it is in the interest of, as Mackenzie said, in the interest of the Taliban that, in fact, ISIS-K does not metastasize beyond what it is, number one. And number two, it’s in their interest that we are able to leave on time, on target. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a consequence of that, the major things we’ve asked them—moving back the perimeter; give me more space between the wall; stopping vehicles from coming through, et cetera; searching people coming through—it is not what you’d call a tightly commanded, regimented operation like the U.S. is—the military is—but they’re acting in their interest—their interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, by and large—and I’ve asked this same question to military on the ground, whether or not it’s a useful exercise. No one trusts them; we’re just counting on their self-interest to continue to generate their activities. And it’s in their self-interest that we leave when we said and that we get as many people out as we can.\n",
      "\n",
      "And like I said, even in the midst of everything that happened today, over 7,000 people have gotten out; over 5,000 Americans overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, it’s not a matter of trust, it’s a matter of mutual self-interest. And—but there is no evidence thus far that I’ve been given, as a consequence by any of our commanders in the field, that there has been collusion between the Taliban and ISIS in carrying out what happened today both in front of the hotel and what is expected to continue for—beyond today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aamer, Associated Press.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Thank you, Mr. President. You have spoken again powerfully about your own son and the weight of these decisions. With that in mind—and also what you’ve said: that the longer we stay, the more likelihood that there would be a major attack—how do you weigh staying even one more day, considering what’s happened?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: Because I think what America says matters. What we say we’re going to do and the context in which we say we’re going to do it, that we do it—unless something exceptional changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are additional American citizens, there are additional green card holders, there are additional personnel of our allies, there are additional SIV card holders, there are additional Afghans that have helped us, and there are additional groups of individuals that have contacted us from women’s groups, to NGOs, and others, who have expressly indicated they want to get out and have gathered in certain circumstances in groups, on buses and other means, that still presents the opportunity for the next several days, between now and the 31st, to be able to get them out.\n",
      "\n",
      "And our military—and, I believe, to the extent that we can do that knowing the threat, knowing that we may very well have another attack—the military has concluded that’s what we should do. I think they’re right. I think they’re correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "And after that, we’re going to be in a circumstance where there are—will be, I believe, numerous opportunities to continue to provide access for additional persons to get out of Afghanistan, either through means that we provide and/or are provided through cooperation with the Taliban. They’re not good guys, the Taliban. I’m not suggesting that at all. But they have a keen interest. As many of you have been reporting, they very much would like to figure out how to keep the airport open. They don’t have the capacity to do it. They very much are trying to figure out whether or not they can maintain what is the portion of an economy that has become not robust, but fundamentally different than it had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so there’s a lot of reasons why they have reached out not just to us, but to others, as to why it would be continued in their interest to get more of the personnel we want to get out. We can locate them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, there’s not many left that we can assess that are—want to come out. There’s some Americans we’ve identified—we’ve contacted the vast majority of them, if not all of them—who don’t want to leave because they have sig-—they’re dual nationals, they have extended families, et cetera. And there’s others who are looking for the time. So, that’s why we continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll take a few more questions, and—but, you, sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Thank you, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: I didn’t pick you, but that’s okay. (Laughs.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: I wanted to ask you—you say that “what America says matters.” What do you say to the Afghans who helped troops, who may not be able to get out by August 31st? What —\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: I say —\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What do you say to them?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT:—we’re going to continue to try to get you out. It matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, I know of no conflict, as a student of history—no conflict where, when a war was ending, one side was able to guarantee that everyone that wanted to be extracted from that country would get out. \n",
      "\n",
      "And think about it, folks. I think it’s important for—I know the American people get this in their gut. There are, I would argue, millions of Afghani citizens who are not Taliban; who did not actively cooperate with us as SIVs; who, if given a chance, they’d be onboard a plane tomorrow. It sounds ridiculous, but the vast majority of people in communities like that want to come to America, given a choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, getting every single person out is—can’t be guaranteed to anybody because there’s a determination, all who wants to get out as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "At any rate, it’s a process.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was really pointing to you, but—you, sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Thank you, Mr. President. There are reports that U.S. officials provided the Taliban with names of Americans and Afghan officials to evacuate. Were you aware of that? Did that happen?\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, sir, did you personally reject a recommendation to hold, or to recapture Bagram Air Force Base?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: Here’s what I’ve done on the—ask this—I’ll answer the last question, first. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the tactical questions of how to conduct an evacuation or a war, I gather up all the major military personnel that are in Afghanistan—the commanders, as well as the Pentagon. And I ask for their best military judgment: what would be the most efficient way to accomplish the mission.\n",
      "\n",
      "They concluded—the military—that Bagram was not much value added, that it was much wiser to focus on Kabul. And so, I followed that recommendation. \n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to—there are certain circumstances where we’ve gotten information—and quite frankly, sometimes from some of you—saying, “You know of such and such a group of people who are trying to get out and they’re on a bus, they’re moving…”—from other people—“and this is their location.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And there have been occasions when our military has contacted their military counterparts in the Taliban and said, “This…”—for example, “This bus is coming through with X number of people on it, made up of the following group of people. We want you to let that bus or that group through.” \n",
      "\n",
      "So, yes, there have been occasions like that. \n",
      "\n",
      "And to the best of my knowledge, in those cases, the bulk of that has occurred—they’ve been let through. But I can’t tell you with any certitude that there’s actually been a list of names. I don’t—there may have been, but I know of no circumstance. It doesn’t mean it’s not—it didn’t exist, that, “Here’s the names of 12 people; they’re coming. Let them through.” It could very well have happened. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll take one more question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Mr. President, can I —\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Mr. President, right here. Mr. President —\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Let me take the one question from the most interesting guy that I know in the press. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Is that—is there—thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: That’s you. (Laughter.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Mr. President, there had not been a U.S. service member killed in combat in Afghanistan since February of 2020. You set a deadline. You pulled troops out. You sent troops back in. And now 12 Marines are dead. You said the buck stops with you. Do you bear any responsibility for the way that things have unfolded in the last two weeks?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: I bear responsibility for, fundamentally, all that’s happened of late.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here’s the deal: You know—I wish you’d one day say these things—you know as well as I do that the former President made a deal with the Taliban that he would get all American forces out of Afghanistan by May 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "In return, the commitment was made—and that was a year before—in return, he was given a commitment that the Taliban would continue to attack others, but would not attack any American forces. \n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that? I’m being serious. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Mr. President —\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: No, I—I’m asking you a question. Be a—because before I —\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Donald Trump is not the President right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: No, no—now wait a minute. I’m asking you a question. Is that—is that accurate, to the best of your knowledge?\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: I know what you’re talking about. But, Mr. President, respectfully—\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: What?\n",
      "\n",
      "Q:—since—I don’t think that the issue that—do you think that people have an issue with pulling out of Afghanistan, or just the way that things have happened? \n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: I think they have an issue that people are likely to get hurt—some, as we’ve seen, have gotten killed—and that it is messy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason why—whether my friend will acknowledge it and was—reported it—the reason why there were no attacks on Americans, as you said, from the date until I came into office, was because the commitment was made by President Trump: “I will be out by May 1st. In the meantime, you agree not to attack any Americans.” That was the deal. That’s why no American was attacked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: And you said that you still—a few days ago, you said you squarely stand by your decision to pull out.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I do. Because look at it this way, folks—and I’m going to—I have another meeting, for real. But imagine where we’d be if I had indicated, on May the 1st, I was not going to renegotiate an evacuation date; we were going to stay there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d have only one alternative: Pour thousands of more troops back into Afghanistan to fight a war that we had already won, relative—is why the reason we went in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have never been of the view that we should be sacrificing American lives to try to establish a democratic government in Afghanistan—a country that has never once in its entire history been a united country, and is made up—and I don’t mean this in a derogatory—made up of different tribes who have never, ever, ever gotten along with one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, as I said before—and this is the last comment I’ll make, but we’ll have more chance to talk about this, unfortunately, beyond, because we’re not out yet—if Osama bin Laden, as well as al Qaeda, had chosen to launch an attack—when they left Saudi Arabia—out of Yemen, would we have ever gone to Afghanistan? Even though the Taliban completely controlled Afghanistan at the time, would we have ever gone?\n",
      "\n",
      "I know it’s not fair to ask you questions. It’s rhetorical. But raise your hand if you think we should have gone and given up thousands of lives and tens of thousands of wounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our interest in going was to prevent al Qaeda from reemerging—first to get bin Laden, wipe out al Qaeda in Afghanistan, and prevent that from happening again.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I’ve said 100 times: Terrorism has metastasized around the world; we have greater threats coming out of other countries a heck of a lot closer to the United States. \n",
      "\n",
      "We don’t have military encampments there; we don’t keep people there. We have over-the-horizon capability to keep them from going after us. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ladies and gentlemen, it was time to end a 20-year war.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you so much.\n",
