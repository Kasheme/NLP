      "believe that, over time, most rejectionists will be  persuaded to support a democratic Iraq led \n",
      "by a federal government that is a strong enough gov ernment to protect minority rights.  \n",
      "The second group that makes up the enemy in Iraq is  smaller, but more determined. It \n",
      "contains former regime loyalists who held positions  of power under Saddam Hussein -- people \n",
      "who still harbor dreams of returning to power. Thes e hard-core Saddamists are trying to \n",

      "includes terrorists from Saudi Arabia, and Syria, a nd Iran, and Egypt, and Sudan, and Yemen, \n",

      "suicide bombings, and the beheadings, and the other  atrocities we see on our television.  \n",
      "They're led by a brutal terrorist named Zarqawi -- al Qaeda's chief of operations in Iraq -- who \n",

      "And on the economic side, we're helping the Iraqis rebuild their infrastructure, reform their \n",

      "that's the training of Iraqi security forces. To de feat the terrorists and marginalize the \n",

      "the Iraqi role was limited to protecting the flanks  of coalition forces, and securing ground that \n",
      "had already been cleared by our troops. This year i n TAL Afar, it was a very different story.  \n",
      "The assault was primarily led by Iraqi security for ces -- 11 Iraqi battalions, backed by five \n",
      "coalition battalions providing support. Many Iraqi units conducted their own anti-terrorist \n",
      "operations and controlled their own battle space --  hunting for enemy fighters and securing \n",

      "motivated to kill the terrorists.\" Iraqi forces not  only cleared the city, they held it. And \n",
      "because of the skill and courage of the Iraqi force s, the citizens of TAL Afar were able to vote \n",

      "As Iraqi forces increasingly take the lead in the f ight against the terrorists, they're also taking \n",
      "control of more and more Iraqi territory. At this m oment, over 30 Iraqi Army battalions have \n",
      "assumed primary control of their own areas of respo nsibility. In Baghdad, Iraqi battalions \n",
      "have taken over major sectors of the capital -- inc luding some of the city's toughest \n",
      "neighborhoods. Last year, the area around Baghdad's  Haifa Street was so thick with terrorists \n",
      "that it earned the nickname \"Purple Heart Boulevard .\" Then Iraqi forces took responsibility for \n",
      "this dangerous neighborhood -- and attacks are now down.    \n",
      "  \n",
      " \n",
      " 7  Our coalition has handed over roughly 90 square mil es of Baghdad province to Iraqi security \n",
      "forces. Iraqi battalions have taken over responsibi lity for areas in South-Central Iraq, sectors \n",
      "of Southeast Iraq, sectors of Western Iraq, and sec tors of North-Central Iraq. As Iraqi forces \n",
      "take responsibility for more of their own territory , coalition forces can concentrate on training \n",
      "Iraqis and hunting down high-value targets, like th e terrorist Zarqawi and his associates.  \n",
      "We're also transferring forward operating bases to Iraqi control. Over a dozen bases in Iraq \n",
      "have been handed over to the Iraqi government -- in cluding Saddam Hussein's former palace \n",
      "in Tikrit, which has served as the coalition headqu arters in one of Iraq's most dangerous \n",
      "regions. From many of these bases, the Iraqi securi ty forces are planning and executing \n",
      "operations against the terrorists -- and bringing s ecurity and pride to the Iraqi people.  \n",
      "Progress by the Iraqi security forces has come, in part, because we learned from our earlier \n",
      "experiences and made changes in the way we help tra in Iraqi troops. When our coalition first \n",
      "arrived, we began the process of creating an Iraqi Army to defend the country from external \n",
      "threats, and an Iraqi Civil Defense Corps to help p rovide the security within Iraq's borders. \n",
      "The civil defense forces did not have sufficient fi repower or training -- they proved to be no \n",
      "match for an enemy armed with machine guns, rocket- propelled grenades, and mortars. So \n",
      "the approach was adjusted. Working with Iraq's lead ers, we moved the civil defense forces \n",
      "into the Iraqi Army, we changed the way they're tra ined and equipped, and we focused the \n",
      "Army's mission on defeating those fighting against a free Iraq, whether internal or external.  \n",
      "Now, all Iraqi Army recruits receive about the same  length of basic training as new recruits in \n",
      "the U.S. Army -- a five-week core course, followed by an additional three-to-seven weeks of \n",
      "specialized training. With coalition help, Iraqis h ave established schools for the Iraqi military \n",
      "services, an Iraqi military academy, a non-commissi oned officer academy, a military police \n",
      "school, a bomb disposal school -- and NATO has esta blished an Iraqi Joint Staff College. \n",
      "There's also an increased focus on leadership train ing, with professional development courses \n",
      "for Iraqi squad leaders and platoon sergeants and w arrant officers and sergeants-major. A \n",
      "new generation of Iraqi officers is being trained, leaders who will lead their forces with skill -- \n",
      "so they can defeat the terrorists and secure their freedom.  \n",
      "   \n",
      "  \n",
      " \n",
      " 8  Similar changes have taken place in the training of  the Iraqi police. When our coalition first \n",
      "arrived, Iraqi police recruits spent too much time of their training in classroom lectures -- and \n",
      "they received limited training in the use of small arms. This did not adequately prepare the \n",
      "fight they would face. And so we changed the way th e Iraqi police are trained. Now, police \n",
      "recruits spend more of their time outside the class room with intensive hands-on training in \n",
      "anti-terrorism operations and real-world survival s kills.  \n",
      "Iraq has now six basic police academies, and one in  Jordan, that together produce over 3,500 \n",
      "new police officers every ten weeks. The Baghdad po lice academy has simulation models \n",
      "where Iraqis train to stop IED attacks and operate roadblocks. And because Iraqi police are \n",
      "not just facing common criminals, they are getting live-fire training with the AK-47s.  \n",
      "As more and more skilled Iraqi security forces have  come online, there's been another \n",
      "important change in the way new Iraqi recruits are trained. When the training effort began, \n",
      "nearly all the trainers came from coalition countri es. Today, the vast majority of Iraqi police \n",
      "and army recruits are being taught by Iraqi instruc tors. By training the trainers, we're helping \n",
      "Iraqis create an institutional capability that will  allow the Iraqi forces to continue to develop \n",
      "and grow long after coalition forces have left Iraq .  \n",
      "As the training has improved, so has the quality of  the recruits being trained. Even though the \n",
      "terrorists are targeting Iraqi police and army recr uits, there is no shortage of Iraqis who are \n",
      "willing to risk their lives to secure the future of  a free Iraq.  \n",
      "The efforts to include more Sunnis in the future of  Iraq were given a significant boost earlier \n",
      "this year. More than 60 influential Sunni clerics i ssued a fatwa calling on young Sunnis to join \n",
      "the Iraqi security forces, \"for the sake of preserv ing the souls, property and honor\" of the \n",
      "Iraqi people. These religious leaders are helping t o make the Iraqi security forces a truly \n",
      "national institution -- one that is able to serve, protect and defend all the Iraqi people.  \n",
      "Some critics dismiss this progress and point to the  fact that only one Iraqi battalion has \n",
      "achieved complete independence from the coalition. To achieve complete independence, an \n",
      "Iraqi battalion must do more than fight the enemy o n its own -- it must also have the ability \n",
      "to provide its own support elements, including logi stics, airlift, intelligence, and command and \n",
      "control through their ministries. Not every Iraqi u nit has to meet this level of capability in \n",
      "order for the Iraqi security forces to take the lea d in the fight against the enemy.   \n",
      "  \n",
      " \n",
      " 9  As a matter of fact, there are some battalions from  NATO militaries that would not be able to \n",
      "meet this standard. The facts are that Iraqi units are growing more independent and more \n",
      "capable; they are defending their new democracy wit h courage and determination. They're in \n",
      "the fight today, and they will be in the fight for freedom tomorrow.  \n",
      "We're also helping Iraqis build the institutions th ey need to support their own forces. For \n",
      "example, a national depot has been established nort h of Baghdad that is responsible for \n",
      "supplying the logistical needs of the ten divisions  of the Iraqi Army. Regional support units \n",
      "and base support units have been created across the  country with the mission of supplying \n",
      "their own war fighters. Iraqis now have a small Air  Force, that recently conducted its first \n",
      "combat airlift operations -- bringing Iraqi troops to the front in TAL Afar. The new Iraqi Navy \n",
      "is now helping protect the vital ports of Basra and  Umm Qasr. An Iraqi military intelligence \n",
      "school has been established to produce skilled Iraq i intelligence analysts and collectors. By \n",
      "taking all these steps, we're helping the Iraqi sec urity forces become self-supporting so they \n",
      "can take the fight to the enemy, and so they can su stain themselves in the fight.  \n",
      "Over the past two and a half years, we've faced som e setbacks in standing up a capable Iraqi \n",
      "security force -- and their performance is still un even in some areas. Yet many of those forces \n",
      "have made real gains over the past year -- and Iraq i soldiers take pride in their progress. An \n",
      "Iraqi first lieutenant named Shoqutt describes the transformation of his unit this way: \"I really \n",
      "think we've turned the corner here. At first, the w hole country didn't take us seriously. Now \n",
      "things are different. Our guys are hungry to demons trate their skill and to show the world.\"  \n",
      "Our troops in Iraq see the gains that Iraqis are ma king. Lieutenant Colonel Todd Wood of \n",
      "Richmond Hill, Georgia, is training Iraqi forces in  Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit. He \n",
      "says this about the Iraqi units he is working with:  \"They're pretty much ready to go it on their \n",
      "own ... What they're doing now would have been impo ssible a year ago ... These guys are \n",
      "patriots, willing to go out knowing the insurgents would like nothing better than to kill them \n",
      "and their families ... They're getting better, and they'll keep getting better.\"  \n",
      "Our commanders on the ground see the gains the Iraq is are making. General Marty Dempsey \n",
      "is the commander of the Multinational Security Tran sition Command. Here's what he says \n",
      "about the transformation of the Iraqi security forc es: \"It's beyond description. They are far \n",
      "better equipped, far better trained\" than they once  were.   \n",
      "  \n",
      " \n",

      "security _ the Iraqi security forces are regaining control of the country.\"  \n",
      "As the Iraqi security forces stand up, their confid ence is growing and they are taking on \n",
      "tougher and more important missions on their own. A s the Iraqi security forces stand up, the \n",
      "confidence of the Iraqi people is growing -- and Ir aqis are providing the vital intelligence \n",
      "needed to track down the terrorists. And as the Ira qi security forces stand up, coalition forces \n",
      "can stand down -- and when our mission of defeating  the terrorists in Iraq is complete, our \n",
      "troops will return home to a proud nation.  \n",
      "This is a goal our Iraqi allies share. An Iraqi Arm y Sergeant named Abbass Abdul Jabar puts it \n",
      "this way: \"We have to help the coalition forces as much as we can to give them a chance to \n",
      "go home. These guys have been helping us. [Now] we have to protect our own families.\" \n",
      "America will help the Iraqis so they can protect th eir families and secure their free nation. We \n",
      "will stay as long as necessary to complete the miss ion. If our military leaders tell me we need \n",
      "more troops, I will send them.  \n",
      "For example, we have increased our force levels in Iraq to 160,000 -- up from 137,000 -- in \n",
      "preparation for the December elections. My commande rs tell me that as Iraqi forces become \n",
      "more capable, the mission of our forces in Iraq wil l continue to change. We will continue to \n",
      "shift from providing security and conducting operat ions against the enemy nationwide, to \n",
      "conducting more specialized operations targeted at the most dangerous terrorists. We will \n",
      "increasingly move out of Iraqi cities, reduce the n umber of bases from which we operate, and \n",
      "conduct fewer patrols and convoys.  \n",
      "As the Iraqi forces gain experience and the politic al process advances, we will be able to \n",
      "decrease our troop levels in Iraq without losing ou r capability to defeat the terrorists. These \n",
      "decisions about troop levels will be driven by the conditions on the ground in Iraq and the \n",
      "good judgment of our commanders -- not by artificia l timetables set by politicians in \n",
      "Washington.  \n",
      "Some are calling for a deadline for withdrawal. Man y advocating an artificial timetable for \n",
      "withdrawing our troops are sincere -- but I believe  they're sincerely wrong. Pulling our troops \n",

      "\"discourage our troops because it seems to be headi ng for the door. It will encourage the \n",

      "Senator Lieberman is right. Setting an artificial d eadline to withdraw would send a message \n",
      "across the world that America is a weak and an unre liable ally. Setting an artificial deadline to \n",
